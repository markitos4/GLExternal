--- [ GLExternal Executor Source ] ---

V1.00

Simple 'injection' via modulescript bytecode replacing, it doesn't supports any type of execution yet but on futures updates it will!

Takes 3-5 seconds to finish 'injection' and it has 0 unc right now.

Feel free to use it without my pemission as I have made it for everyone's use!
